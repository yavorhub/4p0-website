The SAMS system makes it possible for physicians to perform remote clinical eye examinations. The system is designed to educate and train physicians to better recognize eye movement signs related to certain rare diseases.</p>

As with all rare diseases, the number of physicians with enough experience to diagnose this illness is limited. The SAMS app stores patient exams in the secure cloud where they can be accessed and reviewed by qualified experts in this rare disease. The expert feedback is then made available to the original physician on the SAMS tablet.</p>

Originally conceived as an iPad Pro application, it was quickly determined that the camera placement on the iPad made capturing a head-on, wide view impossible.

			<p class="news--column-caption">The clinical environment of major hospitals created several technical hurdles which had to be considered. Hospitals are highly secure IT environments which means the app had to be developed to work entirely offline and in examination rooms without internet access. This impacts several normal processess such as account creation, but also the ability to sync extremely large video files to the cloud.</p>
